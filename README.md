# Quantitative-Data-Algorithm-Structure

In this project, I mainly did four parts of work.
Simple Moving Average Crossover Strategy: 
We implemented a popular trading strategy, the Simple Moving Average Crossover, using Python NumPy and Pandas. By computing moving averages and detecting crossover points, the strategy can generate buy/sell signals for trading stocks.

Linear OLS Regression on Stocks: 
We utilized scikit-learn's linear regression model to perform Ordinary Least Squares regression on stock data. This approach helps in understanding the linear relationships between stock features and their target values, enabling potential predictions and analysis.

Vectorization and Backtesting: 
We learned about vectorization in NumPy and its benefits, which allow for faster and more efficient computations. We applied vectorization techniques to backtest the trading strategies, enabling quick evaluation and validation of their performance.

Time Series Analysis with Pandas: 
Using Pandas, we explored time series data and its support in Python. Pandas' time series functionality offered efficient data storage formats and convenient manipulation methods for handling time-stamped financial data.
